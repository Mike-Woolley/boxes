**Version 2.1.0 is out**.  
A major enhancement with several new features, including parent configs, scriptable tag queries, alias names,
XDG support, and more<!--break-->:

- Support for XDG base directories. [#69](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/69)  
  This means more config file locations are recognized, such as `$HOME/.config/boxes/boxes-config`. Details
  [in the issue](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/69#issuecomment-782857777).
- Config files may now inherit from one or more so-called *parent config files*.
  [#5](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/5)  
  The config file recursively inherits all designs from its parents, and has the option to override them.
- A box design can now have *alias names* in addition to its primary name.
  [#30](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/30)  
- Major improvements to the Vim syntax file, which now supports the full feature set of *boxes* config files.
  [#63](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/63), [#64](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/64)
- Add support for tag queries. Each box design can be tagged with a number of tags. Calling `boxes -l` will print
  the tag counts at the end of the list. Use `boxes -q` to query the list of designs by tag. This is helpful for
  scripting. [#23](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/23#issuecomment-811763428)
- Add a new option `-e` which can be used to override the line break character used by *boxes* output.
  [#60](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/60)  
  This is an experimental feature. Let us know in the issue if we should keep it or drop it.
- Some minor fixes and enhancements, and a lot of internal improvements
