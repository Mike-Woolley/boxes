**Version 1.1 is out**. Version 1.1 is essentially a maintenance release, which solves all compilation and compatibility issues reported to the author. This mainly affected modern Linuxes. I took the opportunity to also apply all patches that had been submitted, and added tab handling options for leading tabs (see [what's new](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/commits/master)). Get it from the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download.html).

Now, I am looking for help with the binary distributions, which should be brought up to level 1.1. Any contributions are greatly appreciated!
