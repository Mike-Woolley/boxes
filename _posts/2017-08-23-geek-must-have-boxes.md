John Schuster of the "Geek Must Have" blog published a [blog post on
*boxes*](https://geekmusthave.com/?p=2792){:target="_blank"}.\\
It gives very detailed guidance on how to set up *boxes* to work in Windows PowerShell. Thanks John!\\
In short, on Windows, you want boxes.exe and boxes.cfg in the same directory, ideally one that's listed on the `PATH`
environment variable.
