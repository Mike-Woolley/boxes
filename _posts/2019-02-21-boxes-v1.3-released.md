**Version 1.3 is out**.  
This release features a small number of bug fixes and several new box designs<!--break-->:

- The most recent Git hash is now included in the version info output, along with information on whether this build
  included any files or changes not committed to Git. If so, the version info shows a 'dirty' flag.
- Several small changes to reduce compiler warnings on MinGW
- Bug fix: Improve error message for invalid box size on OSX [#54](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues/54)
- Improve handling of partial lines [#57](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues/57). Previously, it sometimes
  happened that an extra blank line was generated when *boxes* was called from a text editor.
- Bug fix: Respect given outfile on box removal [#55](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues/55)
- Fix typo in manpage (thanks [@carnil](https://github.com/carnil))
- Bug fix by [Stephen M. Cameron](https://github.com/smcameron) to eliminate some compiler warnings

- New box designs 'f90-box' and 'f90-cmt' by [Matt Thompson](https://github.com/mathomp4)
- New box designs 'fence', 'important', 'important2', and 'important3' by [bdimych](https://github.com/bdimych)
- [Mike Meyer](https://github.com/meyer)'s 'unicornsay' box design now allows smaller speech bubbles
