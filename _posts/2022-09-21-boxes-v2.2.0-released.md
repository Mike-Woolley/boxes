release: v2.2.0
---

A notable release, including a license upgrade, and cowsay support<!--break-->

- Upgrade the project's license from *GPL-2.0-only* to *GPL-3.0-only*
  [#101](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/issues/101)
- Fix a bug where in some cases, parent config files referenced via <code>:global:</code> were not found
- Fix a bug where automatic quoting of closing comment tags did not work properly for box designs which are
  also comments in some programming language
- Improvements to the Emacs editor integration
  (thanks <span class="atmention">[@balducci](https://github.com/balducci)</span>!)
- Enable box designs made entirely of spaces via the `-c` command line option
  (thanks <span class="atmention">[@Davidy22](https://github.com/Davidy22)</span>!)  
  This is useful in technical cases such as when *boxes* is used to align an entire box in a terminal window.
- Many internal improvements, mostly around testability and testing

- New box designs `cowsay` and `tux`
  (thanks <span class="atmention">[@Davidy22](https://github.com/Davidy22)</span>!)
  [!91](https://github.com/ascii-boxes/boxes/pull/91)<br>
  This is actually something of a big deal, because you can now create an actual cow almost exactly like
  the legendary *cowsay* tool did, using *boxes*. We have official permission by Tony Monroe, author
  of *cowsay*, to offer this. Many thanks <span class="atmention">[@tnalpgge](https://github.com/tnalpgge)</span> -
  or, as we say now, mooo!
