*Boxes* is now available as a chocolatey package. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (or just "choco") is the
popular package manager on Windows. If you have choco, you can now simply

<pre style="background-color: white;"><code>C:\> choco install boxes.portable</code></pre>

and *boxes* will be available on your system.<!--break-->

The choco package is maintained by us, and you'll get the updates, too.

Did you know that you can also install *boxes* using package managers on other platforms?

- **MacOS:** `brew install boxes`
- **Linux:** `apt-get install boxes`
