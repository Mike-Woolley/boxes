I finally put some new box designs submitted by users of *boxes* up on the download page. Also, there is a new patch
by *Elmar Loos*, who added a "repair" option `-m` to *boxes*. Using `-m`, you can remove a damaged box and redraw it
in one go. And last but not least, *Jason Shiffer* updated his
[emacs mode for boxes]({{ site.baseurl }}/editors.html#emacs).
