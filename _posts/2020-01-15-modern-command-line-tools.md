[Patrick Drechsler](https://github.com/draptik) included *boxes* in his list of [Modern Linux Command Line
Tools](https://github.com/draptik/2020-01-modern-linux-command-line-tools/blob/4fe69762950e61cc00c8e16d7566d3774959b4af/slides.md){:target="_blank"}.

We are honored, especially because of the "modern" attribution. :wink:
